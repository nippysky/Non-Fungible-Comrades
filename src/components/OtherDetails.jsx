          <p>
            You heard that right. Along the line, we would release our 3D Models
            exclusively for Comrades. These Models will be involved in numerous
            activities by Panthart, which include Film, and modeling outfits for
            our fashion and lifestyle. So this means Comrades own both the 2D
            and 3D versions of themselves.

          <p>
            Web 3 is still in its infant stage and there is more stuff to do in
            the space. We are open to new ideas a Comrades. We will also invest
            in the metervase by securing our own land from either Sandbox,
            Otherside, or the likes.
